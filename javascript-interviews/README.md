# Behavioral/Soft Skills Questions 

## Tell us about yourself. Experience in domain

 I have more than 10 years experience in software development and I have been working as a web developer during the last 7 years. I've started my carierr in the same year I've graduated from "Automatics, Electronics and Computer Faculty", in 2008. Along the years I switched development between accounting programs, UI web developer, back-end dev, full stack web developer and front-end web developer. In the last 2 years I worked extesively with Front-end technologies like Angular 4, React, Vue.js 2.0, Angular 6, 7, templating languages like Pug, Jade. I worked on Hybris installations and Spring  or Symfony based implementations. I like to be my own devOps when it comes to maintaining VMs or Docker machines (Mongo, MySQL, Elastic Search, Registery containers). I'm passionate about design patterns, clean code, functional, reactive programing styles and securing web apps.

## Why did you choose web development?

I choose web development because this is how I can contribute in many people's life. We are all in real need of using web apps, we services, as they ease out our day to day life. Other software development areas, though extremly important, like embeded development, are more narrowed. Compared to the other software development fields, web development is a broad domain.

- !Sell yourself well: tell about your current SW Engineer position, speak about the projects you worked in, about the role you had and the contribution in those projects you mentioned!
- Present yourself confident, resourceful e.g.

## Most significant Projects

- As most significant projects I worked in, I would mention:

- an educational system for testing and emitting  TWIG  & TOEFEL certifications 
- a transportation system based on Hybris installation
- Telco systems based on Hybris installations
- in retail industry, different apps like Symfony 3 based app for management of discounts from suppliers

## What is the best project you've done?

- at work, the most complex project I worked in, was a educational system for testing and emitting  TWIG  & TOEFEL certifications comprised of 15 projects. I worked in 4 of those but all were in the same Docker image that we used to create Docker container instances in our local environment
- the project I had the most contribution in, was a bid tool where I had to handle and implement some security protocols ( OIDC & OAuth 2) and many others functionalities and features in the app.

- as a side project I have 4 favorite projects and I continue refing them; 3 are public in my git profile, the 4-th is private. 

## What motivates you?

 - Growth in the context of contributing in society! Growing my knowlege motivates me greatly; I am very content and motivated wenever it comes to meeting new people, learning new technologies, finding recepies, tricks that can help me to learn, gather knowledge, be organized and have a ballanced life.
 A steady goal of is gain that power to contribute in society and improve peoples life. For now I contribute mainly not by direct means, automatizing systems for an easier life style.  

## Why you want to work with us?

- the domain is a very attractive one, I see it as a great opportunity to work in banking domain
- the culture of the country is a bit different than the other countries I worked for, thus I will be able to meet new people and enrich my life experience at a faster rate.

## Your hobbies

- When mentioning a hobby, think about what kind of person the employee will perceive you are:

When it comes to hobbies, I must confess I switch a lot between activities. But mainly, all my hobbies resume in creation activities. I get a great pleasure when I rich to the end of a complex or difficult project. The pleasure is even greater when I know with my creation I can contribute or help people. Long before I made beautiful paintings. Lately I developed a passion for a learning based project, side-project of mine. And I also have great interest for securing web apps and design patters study.

## Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In five years I see myself the master of all the knowlege I'm gathering on continuos basis, having a ballanced, healty and fulfilled life. I see my plan for invesment already implemented and I see myself refining or finishing different projects I've already started. I also know I will continue the learning process during my life's journey.

## For how many years you worked with Angular?

I have been working with Angular since 2017.
First contact I had was with AngularJS. In 2018 I worked with Angular Js, Angular 4 and Angular 6. In 2019 with Angular 6 and 7. In 2020 I worked with Angular 7 in a project I had the most contribution on front-end side and where I implemeted some security protocols (OIDC and OAuth 2)

## Did you work before on bank projects?

I didn't but I worked on complex systems and I also made security implementations in Angular. I know security is extremly important in banking projects. 

## 3 things that you can improve at yourself

- First of all, I am aware there is place for great improvement when it comes to public speaking, speaking at conferences, meetings;
- Very important to me is that I progressed in having a ballanced and organized lifestyle, but I do improve on continuos basis, as the requirement is considerable;
- regarding tech skills I have a schema, a plan to follow and here, the environment I work in, comes with great support

### How do you keep up to date with technologies?

I network and I'm part of some groups like Google Talks, Google Meet and I take part at organized meetings and events; I exchange opinions with my colleges; I am part of a great developers comunity where ideas are changed. We have events like lunch and learn; We have engaging meetings where we discuss techical subjects. I have an udemy subscription and I study on continuas basis. I enroll in courses study  on  udemy, pluralsight. I take part in web conferences.

## Do you consider you can bring benefits to the project?

I consider that I can bring a serie of benefits, on the strength of my broad view and rich development experience.
I am always searching for optimizing systems I'm working on, I see when optimization is needed. I am active and engaded, either

## Do you have any questions for us?

How many positions are opened for Angular dev and why you have these openings?
I saw an article about your company laing of x people (x%) of its employees. What kind of positions were eliminated and based on what criteria?

# JavaScript Interview Questions

- !During interview, please give detailed answer to the technical questions you are asked!

# Coding - Algorithms problems

[http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_coding_skills_-_v6.pdf](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_coding_skills_-_v6.pdf)

Solving questions

- analitical skills
- problem solving
- comunication skills
- be eager to solve hard questions, push to hard problems
- have clean code
- have optimal solution ( O space & O time =  Big O)
- make tradeoffs
- strong foundation in CS (Data Structures, Algorithms, Concepts)

Implement DS/Algs - practice on paper; mock interviews( glassdoor, careercup)

Master Big O - How the runtime will scale with time

```JavaScript
//1. Has the complexity O(n) because runtime scales linearly:

for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

//2. Has the complexity O(n*n) because runtime scales linearly:

for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
    for (j=0; j<n; j++) {
    console.log(i, ',',j);

}

//3. Has the complexity O(n) because in big O we are concerned if it scales linearly. We do not say O(2n) or O(half of n) but O(n). We DROP CONSTANTS.

for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
    if (i%2 == 0) {
    console.log(i);

}

//4. Print evens and print odds - We have 2 loops. Each with complexity O(n) because in big O we are concerned if it scales linearly. O(n)+O(n) means a linear complexity: O(n).

for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
    if (i%2 == 0) {
    console.log(i);

}

for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
    if (i%2 != 0) {
    console.log(i);

}
//5. Print ordered pairs - complexity O(n*m) because in big O we use the lenght of the array or the depth of the tree

for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
    for (j=0; j<m; j++) {
    console.log(i, ',',j);

}

//5. Fibonacci part 1 - O(2^k) where the k is the depth of the tree

const fibonacci = function fibo(n) {
        
        if (n === 0 || n===1) {
          return 1;
        } else {
          return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
        }
      };

    /* Runtime is:
              fib(6)
      fib(5)          fib(4)
  fib(4) fib(3)   fib(3) fib(2)
  .............................

  => tree height of k; each level doubles the nodes => 2^k
      
  */
//6. Fibonacci part 1 - O(k) where the k is the depth of the tree

var fibonacci_series = function (n) {
        
        if (n === 1) {
          return [0, 1];
        }
        else {
          var s = fibonacci_series(n - 1); // function is put in call stack and the value of s will be [0, 1]
          s.push(s[s.length - 1] + s[s.length - 2]); // is call from call stack

 

          return s;
        }
      };
    /* Runtime is:
              fib(6)
      fib(5)        x 
  fib(4)     x
  .............................
      => O(k)

      Thus, when you see slow recursive algorithms, think about MEMOIZATION =  look for those repetitive problems
  */
```

For hard algoritms problems, the interviewer needs to see how you think;
- keep tring
- pay attention to the interviewer
- write real code
- declare your variables
- talk out loud to show the interviewer your thought process

- In order to be prepared, practice with algorithms implementations:

[JavaScript algorithms implementions](./javascript-algorithms/README.md)

- [https://www.techseries.dev/daily](https://www.techseries.dev/daily) where you can train at solving problems.

# Design question

1. How would you approach the creation of an app? Do not do the app without first asking some details
2. Scope the problems (ask questions, make appropiate assumptions)
3. Define KEY concepts( can be somewhat naive)
4. Identify issues - botleneck trade-offs
5. Repair and Redesign

Example: Mention Layers: Front-end layer, Caching Layer, APIs Layer, Controller Layer, Data Layer
 and after that, add details for each layer;

 Drive discussion, but also be very sensitive about what the interviewer says. Read about desing of major companies - Just think about how they are done, do not memorize.
