# Lesson learned - life is far easier when you have clarity and structure in your life! Be organized!

What I've learned the hard way is the fact that when developing a software we must have clear structure. All rules of life apply in sw dev. Here the requirement of clarity translates as following:

## a) Understand terminology, language gives you power!

Document yourself very well. Give time to study the language you what to use when you make an implementation.
Each language, framework or library becomes very pleasant when you see it like a real life entity. When you find analogies between concepts from a language and real life, things stay in memory and the language makes more sense. The main reason we use programming is to make our life easier, by automatization of life work. The best part is that all processes around us, are great models to emulate. When it comes to coding, working mecanical is a very bad practice. To prevent this, we need to master some linguistic concepts.
 For me, learning JavaScript becomes much easier when I use terms certain terms that I'm very familiar with, in my day to day life. Language is power, even though we are referring just to coding skills.
 For example, when you hear ``context``, this  means environment:  the global execution context = global environment; 
 Another useful thing in JavaScript as to see everything as an ``object``. Actually, in JavaScript, arrays are objects, functions are objects. Basically, do consider everything as an object, excluding the data types of type primitives (number, string, Boolean, null, undefined). Thus, also the environment is an object => global context  = window object = `this`.
 The window object has all kind of properties (inner objects =  objects that are inside the global environment). Thing at the window opened in your browser - it has inside all kind of stuff. There are a series of layers in a window, holding lots of data, stuff in order to render the final data that the visitor of that page sees. Like a human being that has organs that have, at their turn, cells... like that is the environment JavaScript is providing to you :-).

## b) develop and verify (test) your products based on clear use cases:

- start from the simplest scenario (equals variable initialization) and elaborate on it (add the algorithm)
- if it's hard to get I a natural way this kind of good structure simple follow the model of TDD (test driven design) and Unit testing
- develop a few features/products based on such clear structures and you will get clarity
- basically what we do in programming is to use abstractions in order to solve complex problems of automatizing processes from real life
- nowadays coders are all around the word and compete with numerous programmers working remotely
- thus higher salaries in SW dev will no longer be for ordinary programmers, but rather for those that have more managerial skills, people skill, broader perspective and great ideas to develop upon

## c) Make yourself better at speaking about technical subjects by recording yourself speaking

Video content ideas:

- Video 1: spend time in productive manner: work on a blog, contribute with useful content on YouTube, contribute on a open source project
- Video 2: explain my Marble Testing - Unit Testing GitHub repo or any other repo with the subject I need to deepen at that time being
- Video 3: Security with Angular - securing Angular App - about the notes I took in my private repo
- Video 4: career subject - video talk about my programming experience - projects I worked in, how the interviewing process goes

# How to provide tasks estimations
- Usually is better to provide as time required to complete a task, the double of time you first believe it will take
 - if you do not know the section/feature to implement/scale or the feature is bright new, requires integration and/or FRD(functional requirements description)/SAD(software arhitecture design) implementation consider to allocate double the time for it's implementation - especially if there is a critical feature(structural/requires to be highly scallable)
 - ask if unit testing needs to be included
 - break each task/story into subtasks and provide estimation for each task
 - allocate time in the sprint for code reviews and helping others to complete/design their implementations
 - you also need to investigate managers and colleague’s psychology and understand their working style
 - highlight what is missing from scrum implementation, which will better help development process
 - have in mind that a working day has a max of 7hours for development (1 hour is company meetings/emails and formalities)
 - log on each task the time you spent during the day (no matter if the task was assigned to you or not) - create the task if required
 - do not work on multiple projects in the same day
 - do not work on multiple tasks at the same time
 - if others need your help, allocate them time after you complete your task, or, at the end of the day (after interruption you will need more than 15min to be fully focused, back, on your task)
# How to increase your productivity

1.	Remove distractions:
-	Deactivate all notifications not related to your current task/job
-	Allocate a limited amount of approx. 30min/day for e-mail correspondence – depending on the job, if possible
-	Allocate max 15min/day in the afternoon for social media
2.	For all non-critical areas of your life put yourself in position where you do not have to take decision (for dressing – prepare all your dressing sorted during leisure/weekend time, for groceries shopping – delegate …)
3.	Fewer meetings, strict agenda with only the strictly required attendees – those that contribute and benefit in a significant way
4.	AVOID information overload! Apply what you learned with PURE ACTION and never get stuck when you need to put it in practice.
5.	Always have in mind the opportunity cost – delegate low income activities and energy consuming tasks with low benefits
6.	Use the most productive time between 6 a.m. and 12 a.m. for hard or creativity activities. Go to sleep when you are too tired to read and get up at a fix hour like 6 a.m.
7.	Use daily/weekly/yearly plans like the ones from TODOIS – make hierarchical tasks according priorities and importance in achieving your long-term vison
8.	Have annually review – what works, what does not.
9.	Never share your goals with anyone that cannot take part or contribute to achieve that goal. Thus, you will avoid feeling good just by dreaming you already achieved the goal – and you will not work hard towards achieving it. In case your priorities in life, along the years, change you will not face any social pressure to accomplish the old goal, that is not any more on your vision. 
10.	 For intense focused tasks block in your calendar the required time intervals, when you will not check emails or do anything else then the task itself. Leave 1h time before and after these time intervals (as backup time to finish/take breaks)
11.	 Actions give you -> motivation and productivity
12.	 Optimize the work: do the task fast – in approx. 30% of the time provided as estimation and finish all the work before 5 p.m.
13.	 Use pomodoro technique: 25min intense/focused work + 5min break for diffuse mode – physical exercise
14.	 Bach similar tasks
15.	 Listen to music (the best, for me, is programming music) for repetitive tasks, that do not require high creativity effort. Some music with lyrics is bad for retaining/learning new info. Generally, music is great for people working in loud environments. Good music: Classic (e.g. 4 Seasons), Electronic, game sound tracks, Brain.fm, noisli.com 

# Offboarding interviu questions

- How were your interactions the experiences in the company?
I have been experiencing a great deal of pleasant meetings and discussions and exciting experiences, especially during company events: team buildings, community days. I had the opportunity to work and meet tens of colleagues. I had the opportunity to work and have as great examples of organization and communication 4 managers; I learned from them the wisdom to listen patiently, to defend team members, to clearly highlight team members’ strengths, take complete notes by the means of fast typing; During 2years and 3months I worked directly with more than 30 developers from which I have learned the importance of communication and the importance of mastering technologies you are working with. 

- How were the trainings? I find trainings during the time spent in the company the best and most exciting part of this time. I took part just once at Google Meets, but in the same time practice lead provided us great learning resources (both courses and time). I give 10+ grade for this awesome benefit!

- How were the career performance evaluations - not enough opportunities for someone who was very busy working on 6 projects for 2 years and 3 months’ time, during which time he had just one evaluation - just one session of feedback gathering - just from one project and a half. Basically, all the positive feedback from other projects was lost and the career advancement during more than 2 years’ time was unfairly slow. It is a great advantage to stick for more time with one technology if there is just small increase in salary. This is one of the decision factors to change companies. Opportunity to use the knowledge base that I gathered arrived. Switching projects to often in the same company, may have the benefit of gaining more experience, but it seems it does not bring enough material benefits, unless you especially ask for it. 

 Another decision factor to leave the company it was self-evaluation that I made for myself working for the last client/projects. Though technical lead, team leaders, project managers and all team members acknowledged my high technical abilities and contribution, there were to required organization aspects missing from development process. Previous promotion was unusually done promoting very low technical people delivering low quality/not scalable software in short timely manner.
