In order to work with ES7 and respectively ES8 features you have to run:

`npm install --save-dev babel-preset-latest --save-dev`

That said, let’s highlight some important concepts that appeared in this section on ES7 and ES Proposals:


ES7 released the new exponent operator which replaces ```Math.pow(x, y)``` with ```x ** y```;

ES7 standardized the ```.includes()``` method for arrays which checks if an element exists within an array collection.

```Object.values()``` returns an array of an object’s values as part of the new ES proposal to improve the Object prototype.

```Object.entries()``` returns an array of an **object’s keys** and values as part of the new ES proposal to improve the Object prototype.

The ```async``` keyword introduces async functions in ecmascript and **allow for more controlled flow of asynchronous functions**.

The ```await``` keyword adds blocking to asynchronous functions in order to temporarily stop the execution of statements and logic until certain data finishes returning a response.

Overall, knowing the features of ES7 and understanding some of the major ES proposals will undoubtedly put you in an advantage as a modern JavaScript developer. Knowing ES6 thoroughly already adds a substantial piece to your skillset, but ES7 and pre-ES8 wisdom will open even more doors!

With this newfound knowledge, you must merely await for all the awesome opportunities in store!

ES6 ** ES7 = awesomeness! :)
